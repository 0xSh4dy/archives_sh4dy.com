- Find the middle node of a linked list -> use a fast and a slow pointer, where the fast ptr moves two steps and the slow ptr moves one step at a time.

- Linked list palindrome detection -> get a pointer to the middle node, reverse the list from mid to end and then compare.

- Intersection of two linked lists -> calculate the difference (d) b/w no. of nodes in the two lists, move the head of larger list d times. This will make the two ptrs equidistant from the node of intersection.
