Here, we are going to cover some more interesting concepts involved in Glibc heap exploitation.

## global_max_fast
`global_max_fast` is a global variable that holds the size of the largest fastbin. In glibc, the size range of fastbins is (0x20 to 0x80). Changing the value of `global_max_fast` to a large positive value allows the attacker to create fast chunks of enormous size which can further be used to perform a fastbin attack. The value of `global_max_fast` can be easily modfied by executing an Unsorted bin attack. Thus, large free chunks will get inserted into the fastbin instead of any other bin.

## House of Husk
This is an awesome technique developed by [ptr-yudai](https://ptr-yudai.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/04/02/111507) . The default value of `global_max_fast` is a fixed value

```
#define set_max_fast(s) \
  global_max_fast = (((s) == 0)                                                      \
                     ? SMALLBIN_WIDTH : ((s + SIZE_SZ) & ~MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK))
```
We know that the pointers to fastbins are stored in the `main_arena`. Thus, modifying the value of `global_max_fast` to a large value will allow us to overwrite the data present in the `main_arena`.
