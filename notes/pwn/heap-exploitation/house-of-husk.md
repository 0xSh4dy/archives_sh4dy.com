Here, we are going to cover some more interesting concepts involved in Glibc heap exploitation.

## global_max_fast
`global_max_fast` is a global variable that holds the size of the largest fastbin. In glibc, the size range of fastbins is (0x20 to 0x80). Changing the value of `global_max_fast` to a large positive value allows the attacker to create fast chunks of enormous size which can further be used to perform a fastbin attack. The value of `global_max_fast` can be easily modfied by executing an Unsorted bin attack. Thus, large free chunks will get inserted into the fastbin instead of any other bin.

## House of Husk
This is an awesome technique developed by [ptr-yudai](https://ptr-yudai.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/04/02/111507) . House of Husk doesn't depend on the version of glibc as long as fastbin and unsorted bin attack are available.

### register_printf_function
This function registers a new format string for printf. It internally calls `__register_printf_specifier` and allocates `__printf_arginfo_table` using calloc.
